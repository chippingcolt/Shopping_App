# Shopping Web Application
Website to allow users to add items to a shopping cart and leave reviews.
Goal is to showcase the following technologies:

MVC architecture including routing -> is located in the entire app. I am using laravel as an api and hitting throutes using axios in Vue.js

Object-Relational Model (ORM). I am using eloquent in Laravel as the ORM in models and services
Single-Page Application (SPA). Vue.js allows me to load data to the store and not refresh pages depending on changes with vue router

Dependency Injection (DI). I am using a contract service flow so I am injecting in Service directory, contract, services, interface

Authentication using JWT. I am using JWT and passing the token in the headers.

FOR THE A.
Unit testing was done.  I am using a contract service design, I am two tables with a one to many relationship.  reviews and products.  I also have used a VueX for state management.
